# Fiance_tracker
Hey Pirates! I've built an expense tracker that automatically scans your email for bank transaction alerts and records your personal expenses into a Google Sheet. This is my first project so I hope you guys would like it.

The best thing about it is that it is *completly private. So you can have the peace of mind that even though it is scaning your email only you are the one it is reporting to.

## **Technolgy used**

HTML for the web interface
JavaScript for adding your credit or debit card

## **Make it yours**

I have left comments at various places in the HTML file as well as in the Javascript file. Pritates you can change almost all of the CSS without knowing how to code as I have left comments for you guys. You can also add other cards into it. The process is quite simple and straightforward.
## Any Questions
Please reach out if you have any problems in it. Have tested it out and works fine for me. Should have any problems for you guys.
All instructions have been given in the file.
